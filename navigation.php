    <p>
      <span>The first page you should know of is probably the most important to the webpage itself.</span>
      <span>It's the origin of the whole page.</span>
      <span>I call it "Ideas" because it's a place for me to get my thoughts out.</span>
      <span>I always start my adventures on the computer with writing down thoughts and ideas i've collected.</span>
    </p>

      <span>The next page is sorta like a Daily Update page.</span>
      <span>On this page I want to summarize my day basically.</span>
      <span>I'm thinking I can put a video of me just summarizing my day and talking about all the things I accomplished or didn't.</span>
      <span>I will also include some text, images and links to other pages around the webpage.</span>

  <p>
      <span>There is another key aspect to the webpage that aids me in my everyday climb.</span>
      <span>I call this the "Tomorrow page" because I get to plan my day ahead of time with pictures cool fonts.</span>
      <span>This is a page I plan on updating everyday.</span>
      <span>Apparently planning your day out gives you incentives to follow it.</span>

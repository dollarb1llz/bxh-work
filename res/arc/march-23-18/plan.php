  <p>
    <span>Tomorrow is going to be a good day, I can feel it.</span>
    <span>I may get stressed out over all the ideas I have.</span>
    <span>But that is normal and that is why we are doing this right here.</span>
    <span>Tomorrow will basically be a normal day tho.</span>

    <span>I'm going to wake up at 4 Am</span>
    <span>Going to make tea and take care of things.</span>
    <span>There's a list of things to do in the morning to set myself up for success.</span>
    <span>Keeping in mind that I still need work to do on the webpage before I can begin I go ahead and begin filming throughout the day.</span>
      <span>brk</span>
    <span>Make sure we Read, Research, Guitar, Stretch and Breathe tomorrow.</span>
    <span>Also don't forget to take Miley for a Jaunt man.</span>
    <span>She deserves it.</span>
    <span>I can't stress the importance of drinking enough water in the morning as well.</span>
  </p>
  <img src="./res/img/back-yard-snow.jpg" class="right"/>
  <p>
    <span>If we have spare time, crunch the webpage.</span>
    <span>You can work on the mobility of the page so it works on mobile.</span>
    <span>Specifically the navigation page.</span>
    <span>We also need to figure out the Archive page and how that is going to look and work.</span>
      <span> brk</span>
    <span>I'm sure you will find other things to work on before we have to leave around 7 to go get Storm.</span>
    <span>That gives me time to chill in the lot for 30 mins and catch up with the online realm.</span>
    <span>Afterwards, get to work and make circles and shit.</span>
    <span>We will work on codecademy, drink water, do pushups and eventually leave.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>When we get out of there, lets hit up a store, grab lettuce and 4 avocados.</span>
    <span>3 for today, 1 for later.</span>
    <span>Lets combo that with some banana's and apples</span>
    <span>Just keep it around 10 dollars.</span>
      <span>brk</span>
    <span>Get home and prepare meal, Skateboard somehow, Dribble somehow, Pump somehow and finish with a trip to the forest to clear your head.</span>
    <span>Afterwards head home and enjoy a solid meal you've prepared before hand.</span>
    <span>go to the computer and do any last work that needs done.</span>
    <span>Take a brisk walk, a shower, breathe stretch and go to rest.</span>

      <p>
        <span>To start the day we need to get up at 4:00am.</span>
        <span>It's going to be dark and cold</span>
        <span>But we need to have that hour of garuanteed alone time in the morning.</span>
        <span>And we will drink our tea in peace.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        <span>Next up is to crunch in some reading & guitar while the tea sits.</span>
        <span>We will be tempted to go on the computer.</span>
        <span>It's important to do these things to set a foundation for the rest of the day.</span>
        <span>We also need to watch a coding video as well as Gardening etc videos depending how strong we want to feel.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        <span>Before we leave for work I want to accomplish a few more things.</span>
        <span>I want to do my strengthening stretches and pushups.</span>
        <span>If I have extra time I will start my daily web bloging - billyxhunter.com</span>
        <span>With even more time I can go out with Miley for a quick Jaunt.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        </p>


  <img class="right" src="./res/img/dog-trail.jpg" />
      <p>
        <span>If I can get to Storms a few minutes early, I can do a few things on my phone.</span>
        <span>I like to get in touch with Richard and support him where I can.</span>
        <span>I can also scroll through some memes</span>
        <span>Find something else to do on the phone that has to do with supporting Rich or joting down ideas on Gab.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        <span>Get to work and work</span>
        <span>Do some codecademy and jot down some ideas on BXH</span>
        <span>Drink a lot of water and do pushups / pull ups</span>
        <span>Take storm home/ to work and grab some lettuce / bannana</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        <span>Get home and work on things that make you feel succesful/ happy</span>
        <span>Skateboard and videotape an ollie</span>
        <span>Basketball and videotape dribbling</span>
        <span>Take Miley for a Run and visit the forest.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        </p>
        <img src="./res/img/swole.jpg" class="left" />
        <p>
        <span>I would also like to do a few exercises in the gym and take a progress pic for BxH</span>
        <span>After the final workout, find time to eat a great meal.</span>
        <span>We should then be excited to add all our content to our webpage!</span>
        <span>We can add to our ideas, make the daily update, schedule for tomorrow and add to the checklist page.</span>
          <span>brk</span>
        <span>At this time I assume we will be around the time to take a bathe.</span>
        <span>So before we jump in the bath we do a litttle prep with water and clothes/ setting bed up and even take a brisk walk.</span>
        <span>Clean up brush teeth</span>
        <span>Light stretch, Breathing exercises, sleep</span>

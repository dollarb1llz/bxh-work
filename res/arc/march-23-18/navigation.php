      <span>The first page you should know of is probably the most important to the webpage itself.</span>
      <span>It's the origin of the whole page.</span>
      <span>I call it "Ideas" because it's <a target="_blank" href="./index.html">a place for me to get my thoughts out.</a><i class="fa fa-lightbulb"></i></span>
      <span>I always start my adventures on the computer with writing down thoughts and ideas i've collected.</span>
    </p>
    <img src="./res/img/deep-thinker.gif" class="left" />
    <p>
      <span>The next page is sorta like a Daily Update page.</span>
      <span>On this page I want to summarize my day basically.</span>
      <span>I'm thinking I can put a <a target="_blank" href="./today.html">video of me just summarizing my day</a> and talking about all the things I accomplished or didn't.</span>
      <span>I will also include some text, images and links to other pages around the webpage.</span>

      <span>There is another key aspect to the webpage that aids me in my everyday climb.</span>
      <span>I call this the "Tomorrow page" because I get to <a target="_blank" href="./tomorrow.html">plan my day ahead of time with pictures cool fonts</a>.</span>
      <span>This is a page I plan on updating everyday.</span>
      <span>Apparently planning your day out gives you incentives to follow it.</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>This next page is<i class="fa fa-key fa-lg"></i>to the webpage.</span>
      <span>I call it the "Checklist" page.</span>
      <span>On this page I put together a <a target="_blank" href="./checklist.php"> collection of activities that make me happy. </a></span>
      <span>For each activity, I have a progression diary.</span>
      <span>I show my progression on each sport with videos and images.</span>
      <span>These are updated daily as well.</span>

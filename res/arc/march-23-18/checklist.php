      <p>
        <span>The greatest feeling is knowing you got up before the sun.</span>
        <span>It's hard, but it's like the most important key to success.</span>
        <span>It helps to prepare clothes and just actions in general the night before.</span>
        <span>It's also very rewarding to take advantage of the silence of the morning by deep breathing outside.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>The magical potion of healing is a great way to start the day. </span>
        <span> I just need something to fill the gap between making the brew.</span>
        <span>Drink as much water and tea as you can.</span>
        <span>And then make sure to read, watch and <a target="_blank" href="./guitar.php">strum the guitar.</a></span>

        <span>I like to watch videos to learn.</span>
        <span>And when I watch educational videos, it's very rewarding.</span>
        <span>You can literally learn anything, but I make sure I stick to the important videos first like coding.</span>
        <span>Also have to beware of the possibility to get caught up in some titties.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Getting passed the Tea process without eating is key man.</span>
        <span>Eating makes me unable to stretch.</span>
        <span>If I can't stretch, I feel very unfulfilled.</span>
        <span>And that's no way to start the day.</span>

        <span>Getting to work on time is another great way to feel good.</span>
        <span>When we get there on time, we work harder and everything seems so more legit</span>
        <span>Then you just have to make sure you make circles and code in that order.</span>
        <span>If we can get to Giant Eagle and <a href="./food.php" target="_blank">grab some lettuce for dinner yeah.</a></span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Throughout the day I want to focus on a few things that will make me feel good at the end of the day.</span>
        <span>I want to keep an eye on my posture, keeping my core engaged whenever possible.</span>
        <span>Also try to BE as relaxed as possible all day, like slow movements and relaxed tone.</span>
        <span>The other thing I want to make sure I do is to just shut up and smile.</span>

        <span>I also want to make sure I document these things that give me joy.</span>
        <span>So that way I can use that footage on my daily video summary.</span>
        <span>I can also use this footage for my checklist pages to show my progress in those areas.</span>
        <span>Which would be dope man.</span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span>To end the day is as important as the begining of the day.</span>
        <span>Work on your
          <a href="./skate.php" target="_blank">Skating</a>,
          <a target="_blank" href="./bball.php">Basketball </a>,
          <a target="_blank" href="./strength.php">Strength</a> and
          <a href="./mind">Spirituality</a>.</span>
        <span>Update yourself on what you've accomplished and plan for the next day with BxH.</span>
        <span>A brisk walk comboed with a bath and deep breathing makes for a good sleep.</span>

      Feels like I have a grip on something very important
      I have a sense of direction again.
      All I need to do is grind it out.
      It just feels good, little nervwrecking as well.
    </p>

      <p>I thought of a way to use social media.
      If I alternate the usage of each platform.
      If I can use each platform like I do with GAb.
      When I think of something that I'd like to share with a friend, I write it down with Gab.</p>

      <p>

      Here's the cool part of it all dude.
      With this theory I can use EACH platform the same way.
      Just using the platform in the way that it provides.
      I'm just confused now with my idea to document my progress with like skating and ballin etc.</p>

        Docment the progress for me?
        When it comes to creating these pages and documenting each day, you have to remember why you wanted to do it in the first place.
        I think of the list that makes me happy.
        And if you're happy in life, your ideas and thoughts you come up with will be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        People may begin to enjoy my thoughts I share.
        They will be like how are you so damn healthy and happy?
        I'll say "Well I do what makes me happy. I document my progress here on billyxhunter.com"
        My webpage will be a reflection of who I am and who I want to be.
      </p>

        <p>
          This webpage is what makes me happy.
        When I document what makes me happy and put it all together here, I get to see the results.
        Social media is a tool to share ideas and thoughts.
        And when people start catching on to my lifestyle, they will want to know more about me.

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        At that point I can direct them to a place where they can learn more about me.
        Then comes bxh.com
        I want it to reflect what makes me happy.
        I want my webpage to reflect who I want to be.</p>

        <p>
        On my webpage, I have everything that makes me who I am
        And I display it in the way that I like.
        It's my own and it takes hard work too.
        I feel like this is what work is this time of age.

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        I have a few more things I'd like to tackle on this webpage.
        I'd like to fix up the navigation on the mobile so it slides from the right with js.
        Also update Logo and look into finding a vector illustrator alternative.

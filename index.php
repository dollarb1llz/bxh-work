    <h2>New Mindset</h2>

    <p>
      <span>Feels like I have a grip on something very important</span>
      <span>I have a sense of direction again.</span>
      <span>All I need to do is grind it out.</span>
      <span>It just feels good, little nervwrecking as well.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>I thought of a way to use social media.</span>
      <span>If I alternate the usage of each platform.</span>
      <span>If I can use each platform like I do with GAb.</span>
      <span>When I think of something that I'd like to share with a friend, I write it down with Gab.</span>

      <span>Here's the cool part of it all dude.</span>
      <span>With this theory I can use EACH platform the same way.</span>
      <span>Just using the platform in the way that it provides.</span>
      <span>I'm just confused now with my idea to document my progress with like skating and ballin etc.</span>

      <p>
        <span>Docment the progress for me?</span>
        <span>When it comes to creating these pages and documenting each day, you have to remember why you wanted to do it in the first place.</span>
        <span>I think of the list that makes me happy.</span>
        <span>And if you're happy in life, your ideas and thoughts you come up with will be happy.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>People may begin to enjoy my thoughts I share.</span>
        <span>They will be like how are you so damn healthy and happy?</span>
        <span>I'll say "Well I do what makes me happy. I document my progress here on billyxhunter.com" </span>
        <span>My webpage will be a reflection of who I am and who I want to be.</span>

        <span>This webpage is what makes me happy.</span>
        <span>When I document what makes me happy and put it all together here, I get to see the results.</span>
        <span>Social media is a tool to share ideas and thoughts.</span>
        <span>And when people start catching on to my lifestyle, they will want to know more about me.</span>
      </p>
      <video loop autoplay class="left">
        <source src="./res/img/fembot-vanessa.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      </video>
      <p>
        <span>At that point I can direct them to a place where they can learn more about me.</span>
        <span>Then comes bxh.com</span>
        <span>I want it to reflect what makes me happy.</span>
        <span>I want my webpage to reflect who I want to be.</span>

        <span>On my webpage, I have everything that makes me who I am</span>
        <span>And I display it in the way that I like.</span>
        <span>It's my own and it takes hard work too.</span>
        <span>I feel like this is what work is this time of age.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I have a few more things I'd like to tackle on this webpage.</span>
        <span>I'd like to fix up the navigation on the mobile so it slides from the right with js.</span>
        <span>Also update Logo and look into finding a vector illustrator alternative.</span>
